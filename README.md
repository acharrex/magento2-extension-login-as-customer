# Magento 2 Login as Customer extension by Shopigo

This extension allows the store owner to enter any customer account by using Magento admin panel, and in only one click!

Our Login as Customer extension makes things more efficient, faster, and more accessible for all parties involved in a transaction – you, as the store owner, and your store’s users, as your customers.

All in all, this extension is a win-win for everyone involved on all sides of the fence – your customers will be better, faster and more efficiently treated and you will save time, money and effort in doing so.

Aside from being able to login as a customer without asking for any kind of credentials, our extension will also allow you to:
- Visualize your store as a customer (which can be extremely helpful if you want to spot various issues with your site – and find solutions for them);
- See your store’s logins history (which can be very useful for employee training and clarifying security issues).
